The PrivateVariableInspector contract provides a mechanism for inspecting private variables in Solidity smart contracts. 
In Solidity, variables marked as private are not directly accessible from external contracts or through regular function calls. 
However, with the PrivateVariableInspector contract, developers can leverage its functionality to retrieve the values of private variables.
